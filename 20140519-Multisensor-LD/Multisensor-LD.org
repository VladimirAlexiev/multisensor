* General linked data
FactForge
- DBpedia
- GeoNames
- FreeBase
- New York Times
- CIA World FactBook
- MusicBrainz (irrelevant)
- WordNet, Lingvoj, Lexvo
Possible changes/additions
- Update datasets
- BaseKB instead of FreeBase
- OpenStreetMap
* FactForge
[[http://factforge.net/][./img/factforge-large.png]]
- An RDF warehouse of the 9 most central LOD datasets (red below)\\
  [[./img/lod-datasets-2009-03-27-FactForge-LLD.jpg]]
- A reason-able view over the web of data, which allows efficient linking and reasoning.
- Exposed to Multisensor as http://render.ontotext.com/ (allows writing).
- [[http://www.ontotext.com/factforge/statistics3][Dataset statistics]]
* PROTON
Problem: each of the LOD datasets comes with its own ontology.
- Freebase isn't even structured according to RDF/RDFS principles.
Our approach:
- [[http://www.ontotext.com/proton-ontology][PROTON]] (PROTo ONtology): a lightweight upper-level ontology
- Serves as a reference mapping layer so you can access the integrated LOD datasets in a uniform manner
- Examples at http://factforge.net/sparql (contrasts access throuh PROTON vs DBpedia and GeoNames ontologies)
- [[http://mklab2.iti.gr/multisensor/index.php/Render_OWLIM_Repository][RENDER Repository]] page in the wiki, including presentation from Sofia meeting

* DBpedia
#+ATTR_HTML: width=50
[[http://dbpedia.org][./img/dbpedia_logo.png]]\\
DBpedia is the central LOD dataset, serving as a source of stable URLs and a "crystallization point" for other LD.
- English version: 4M things, 3.22M classified in a consistent ontology:
  - 832k persons
  - 209k organizations (49k companies, 45k educational institutions)
  - 639k places (427k populated places)
  - 372k creative works (116k music albums, 78k films, 18.5k video games)
  - 226k species, 5.6k diseases
- Localized versions (119 languages): 24.9M things
  - 16.8M overlap (interlinked) with English Dbpedia, 8.1M (32%) are new
- 12.6M unique things with labels and abstracts
- 24.6M links to images
- 27.6M links to external web pages, 45M links into other RDF datasets
- 67M links to Wikipedia categories, 41.2M to YAGO categories
- 2.46B triples
  - 470M from English Wikipedia
  - 1.98B from other language editions
  - 45M from links to external datasets

* FreeBase
[[https://www.freebase.com/][./img/freebase-logo.png]]
- 43.7M "topics": like WikiPedia pages or DBpedia resources, 
  typically lists of things (albums of a band, battles of a war, ingredients of a recipe...). 2.5B facts (triples) 
- 3.5x bigger coverage than English DBpedia, 2.3x bigger than all DBpedias
- Human-curated fact creation, so supposedly higher quality than DBpedia:\\
  (WikiPedia is curated, DBpedia *mappings* are curated, but DBpedia is automatically extracted)
- Doesn't use RDFS modeling (e.g. no rdf:type). We've done significant work in mapping to RDFS and PROTON
[[./img/freebase-numbers.png]]
* GeoNames
[[http://www.geonames.org/][./img/globe.gif]] *GeoNames*
- 8M place names (compare to 0.64M English DBpedia, estimated 1M all DBpedias, 1M FreeBase)
- Includes place names and alternate names in many languages
- Includes administrative hierarchy
- Includes coordinates (points only)
- I expect that most are interlinked to DBpedia
- Covers all countries, and a rich range of features
[[./img/geonames-feature-counts.png]]
* New York Times, CIA World FactBook
[[http://data.nytimes.com][New York Times data]]
- 5k people, 3k organizations, 2k locations, 0.5k concepts
- Other factual data
- Strong US bias
- (?) Explore deeper for useful News patterns/ontologies?
[[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/][CIA World FactBook]]
- General geopolitical data: history, people, government, economy, geography, communications, transportation, military, and transnational
- Covers most countries: 267 world entities
- Don't know whether the LD is kept up to date
Much smaller but still important resources
* Possible Changes/Additions to FactForge
Although FactForge integrates the above described datasets, it has some disadvantages
- Most importantly, it has not been updated in the last couple of years
- Eg DBpedia Live mirrors the minutely changes of Wikipedia.\\
  But this is hard to implement, since we make corrections and mappings on top of DBpedia
- Potentially it can be extended with new datasets, if needed by the project:\\
  OpenStreetMap/LinkedGeoData, WikiData, and Linguistic LD
[[http://basekb.com/][BaseKB Lime]] instead of FreeBase 
- Removes some 13M erroneous and 100M redundant triples
- Resilient towards errors in NTriples format: skips the line instead of rejecting the whole file ("parallelSuperEyeball" module)
- [[https://github.com/paulhoule/infovore/wiki][Infovore Framework]]: allows to transform a more recent Freebase RDF dump (Last one is from 201303)
* OpenStreetMap and LinkedGeoData
[[http://www.openstreetmap.org][./img/openstreetmap.png]] OpenStreetMap
- An open manually curated map of the world
- Thousands of types of features, ways and areas; from the monumental to the micro scale:\\
  continents, oceans, mountains,\\
  cities, monuments, power stations,\\
  roads, power lines, rivers, parks, areas,\\
  pharmacies, stores, phone boxes, recycling bins...
- Integration of GPS tracks and easy editors for adding annotations
#+ATTR_HTML: width=50
[[http://linkedgeodata.org][./img/linkedgeodata.png]]
- Conversion of OSM to RDF: 15B triples
- Links to DBpedia, GeoNames, UN FAO Geopolitical data
- Last updated: just now (13 May 2014)
* WikiData
[[http://www.wikidata.org/][./img/wikidata.png]]
- Provides atomic facts taht can be referenced in various WikiMedia sites
- Thus it is quite amenable to RDF use
- However, the data is still in its inception
- Furthermore, the facts can presumably be used from the WikiMedia sites, eg DBpedia
* Use-case specific linked data
For the specific use cases, we'll need to assemble specific datasets
- The depth, breadth, content interlinking etc will be dictated by the needs of the use cases
We can elaborate, assemble and complement this only together!
- Both to be goal-driven (what data do you need)
- And to find the data (what data you have stumbled upon)
- Ontotext will assess the data found and look at interlinking (also related to T4.3 alignment)
- Maybe some "crowd-sourcing" will be needed (eg DBpedia subsets)
* Energy Simulation
Identified all named entities *and concepts* in an Energy article by hand
- Compared with REEGLE Tagging API (automatic annotation from a thesaurus dedicated to energy) and DBpedia Spotlight
- Shows the manual annotation is much richer & precise. Would require very powerful tools. Probably overly ambitious: this is a "programme maximum"
- Once we decide what is a feasible set of features to extract, we could write up Annotation Guidelines that can be used by manual annotators to build a Gold Standard corpus to be used for Machine Learning. What do you think (?)

"Standard" metadata, which doesn't mean it will be easy to extract. 
- DCTerms provides properties for a lot of these
- Added MARC Relators, esp. where there's no DCTerms field

* Energy Datasets
Keeping the Energy article simulation in mind, what are possible sources for those entities and concepts?\\

Named entities:
- I think we'll cover quite a lot of the domain of interest by using datasets already integrated in FactForge: DBPedia, GeoNames, FreeBase and NY Times
- There are better sources for energy-specific entities (e.g. Power Plants)
Concepts:
- Below are examples from various thesauri
- When a resource is present in several thesauri, we can often find interlinks (alignments), and then enlarge the scope by exploring around the hierarchy.
- A potential problem in general theasuri is coverage: I don't know how much of the desired terms are covered, so we may have to pick and choose from various thesauri
DBPedia
- DBpedia provides both entities and concepts/categories.
- Related concepts can be extracted by links navigation and using the Categories (see below)
- Person: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Fischedick (related to Wuppertal Institute)
- Event: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster.\\
  - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima is a disambiguation (redirection) page that leads to the above (amongst other things). Thus redirection pages provide synonyms (altLabels)
* General Thesauri
Example concept: "Wind Energy"
- DBpedia: http://de.dbpedia.org/page/Windenergie, http://en.dbpedia.org/page/Wind_power.
  - Although these mean the same, they don't have the same data and links!

* Use-case specific DBpedia subsets
DBpedia is a rich source of concepts and stable URLs with universal coverage.
- Most of the energy Concepts I outlined can also be found in DBpedia
- Wikipedia has a lot of synonyms (wiki redirect links, disambiguation pages), categories, lateral hierarchies/topic guides
- These can help to fish out the concepts
Because it's a folksonomy (not curated according to ISO thesaurus construction precepts), one cannot use hierarchical structure directly, and needs to pick and choose. How to find useful groupings for a specific use case?
- It requires manual curation & crowdsourcing
- Can complement manual & automated effort (machine learning, clusterization)
Example: *Film Genres*
- Explore one genre: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_movie
- And you find Categories: Film genres (other genres), Horror films (instances of horror films)
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Film_genres includes 239!
- Including "Mexploitation" (think El Mariachi, Desperado), "Mafia comedy", etc
- "Mexploitation" is a subkind of "Exploitation film", which also includes:
  - Blaxploitation Bruceploitation Cannibal Eurospy Giallo Hixploitation Martial arts Mexploitation Mockbuster Mondo Nazi exploitation Nunsploitation Outlaw biker Ozploitation Poliziotteschi Pornochanchada Rape and revenge Sexploitation Slasher Spaghetti Western Splatter Sword-and-sandal Women in prison
- "Bruceploitation" isn't really about exploitation: it involves the use of Bruce Lee look-alike actors
- So it really takes intellectual effort to explore these facsinating networks of meaning

* Semantics3 Product Data
https://www.semantics3.com/#sampleapi
- Startup company affiliated with National University of Singapore
- Web mining of big product sites (TechCrunch article says 250Gb per day on a 250-node cluster)
- Excellent way of presenting the data. Convenient API, signup (eg with Github account), excellent web presentation
- They get product and dynamic pricing data
- They charge for the pricing data, but maybe they'll give us the brand name list for free, since we're a research project?
