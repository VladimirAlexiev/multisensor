These are Turtle versions of OLiA ontologies downloaded from http://purl.org/olia/ (http://www.acoli.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/resources/olia/).
Most of these ontologies are used by Multisensor and will be loaded to the Multisensor repository.

In some cases I have fixed minor aspects, eg:
- ~rdf:subClassOf~ instead of ~rdfs:subClassOf~
- URL written as literal (eg "http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-1234") instead of proper URL
- Replaced empty prefix ~:~ with a non-empty one (eg ~olia:~)
- Used prefixes as much as possible

In all cases I've sorted the elements alphabetically in the following sections (look for ~###~):
- Ontology declaration
- Classes
- Properties
- Individuals
- External elements
